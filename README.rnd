PoC Session management with Cassandra.
======================================

PoC for a json session manager based on Casssandra 2.0.
Rather than storing all session data, only changes are stored as a time serie and merged during read.


Sample Code
===========
Please have a look at the tests :

* AppSessionTest: to see how to add attributes to the session.
* AppSessionDAOTest: to see how to save/load session.
